Gender wage gap simulator

To run:
* Make sure you are alone
* Clone the code somewhere where no one will ever find it
* `npm install` the shit out of it
* Open the file and enter data points that you want to play with and learn nothing from
* Run `node index.js` or however else you want to run it (free world eh)
